# 2017 GOP Grad Tax Impact Shiny App

This shiny app was built in response to the House GOP Tax Bill provision that would make tuition waivers taxable.  The app allows graduate students to input their current annual stipend, along with the cost of tuition (currently paid for by their department, untaxed), to compare their 2018 federal income tax estimates as they would be with and without this bill.
